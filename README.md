# Leet Code

> Author: Justin Hoang

My repository containing my Leet Code solutions.

## Workflow

- No external libraries
  - Builtins from `python` like `collections` is fine
- Each problem will be solved under its own pull request.

- Simple text editors or IDEs like `neovim`, Zed, and Kate with an LSP
