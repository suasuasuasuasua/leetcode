My repository containing my Leet Code solutions. I am going to solving these
mostly in `python`, as this is my language of choice at work. I may dabble in
other languages like `C++` and learn languages like `Go` along the way. It's not
that important to me what language it is in though, as the concepts are more
important and transcend the language.

## About

I'm honestly not the greatest coding challenge solver, so this is going to be a
journey. It is a bit embarrassing that I have a Master's degree, but I can still
struggle with these ideas lol. It's fine, real world applications are not going
to ask you to do any of these things, but I do want to keep my skills sharp in
case I do want to change jobs to a company that does value these skills.
